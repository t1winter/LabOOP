Question: When should accessor methods be used?
Accessor methods are used to access and modify the private fields of a class while controlling how the data is handled and ensuring encapsulation
Some cases to use accessor methods:
+ Encapsulation: Accessor methods (getters and setters) help you keep the internal data of an object private while still allowing controlled access
+ Controlled Access and Modification: Accessors allow you to implement custom logic when accessing or modifying an attribute, such as lazily computing a value, updating related fields, or logging changes
+ Supporting Inheritance and Extensibility: In inheritance, accessors allow subclasses to override methods to adjust how data is accessed or set without changing the superclass's core implementation.

Question:  If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: No, because they have the same signatures.
